unk depending on ring size and steric properties but independent from high dilution the unk condensation of unk favours intramolecular unk over intermolecular polymerisation
ring strain intermolecular and intramolecular interactions
this forms an intramolecular unk
the intramolecular reaction of a carboxylic acid with an amides is far faster than the intermolecular reaction which is rarely observed
however intramolecular hydrogen bonding can be an example of a stabilizing unk interaction
evidence for inter unk and intramolecular mechanisms have been obtained by so-called unk with mixed reactants
if the resulting unk ionized unk state is higher in energy than the double ionization threshold of subunit a then an unk unk intramolecular unk process unk unk in the case of core ionization auger decay unk sets in
this enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases specifically those intramolecular transferases transferring amino groups
it is a natural lactone that derives from the intramolecular cyclization of a cinnamic acid derivative
self-assembly may be subdivided into intermolecular self-assembly unk to form a supramolecular assembly unk and intramolecular self-assembly unk or folding as demonstrated by unk and polypeptides unk
this reaction is described as an intramolecular double mannich reaction for obvious reasons
rcm is simply an intramolecular olefin metathesis with a grubbs catalyst yielding the unk and a volatile alkene in this example ethene
in one specific type of radical addition called unk oxidative radical cyclization alkynes are oxidized to ketones with intramolecular ring closure and the radical species are inorganic rather than carbon based
