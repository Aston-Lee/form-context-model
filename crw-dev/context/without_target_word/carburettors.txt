power came from a substantially reworked colombo v12 still with two valves per cylinder but now with a unk engine and six as standard
engines of a similar power output were typically assigned different model numbers based on supercharger or propeller gear ratios differences in cooling system or engine block construction starting system or arrangement of engine controls
