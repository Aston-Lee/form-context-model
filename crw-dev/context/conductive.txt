when an electromagnetic wave interacts with a material mobile charges within the material are made to oscillate back and forth with the same frequency as the impinging fields
the resulting structure is believed to be a unk since it is not electrically but leads rapidly to the creation of a pore
for example in an integrated circuit the gallium beam could be used to cut unwanted electrical connections to deposit material in order to make a connection
an ec system essentially consists of pairs of metal plates in parallel which act as monopolar electrodes
these same vibrations however are good sensation guides for the singer regardless of their effect on the external sound
